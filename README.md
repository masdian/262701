## Quick Start

### Using this template

1.  Click the “Use this template” button at the top of this repository
2.  Name your new repository and create it
3.  Clone your new repository to your local machine

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
```

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed. Download it
from
[quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

To verify Quarto is installed:

``` bash
quarto --version
```

### Customize your book

1.  **Edit `_quarto.yml`** to update:

    - Book title and author
    - Repository URL
    - Chapter list
    - Theme and styling options

2.  **Modify `index.qmd`** to create your book’s homepage/introduction

3.  **Edit or create chapters** (`.qmd` files):

    - Modify `chapter1.qmd` and `chapter2.qmd` as needed
    - Create new chapters and add them to the `chapters` list in
      `_quarto.yml`

4.  **Add references** to `references.bib` in BibTeX format

5.  **Customize styling** in `styles.css`

## Building the book

### Local preview

To preview your book with live reload during development:

``` bash
quarto preview
```

This will open your book in a web browser and automatically refresh when
you make changes.

### Render the book

To render the complete book:

``` bash
quarto render
```

The output will be generated in the `docs/` directory.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) that automatically builds and
publishes your book to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

### Setup steps:

1.  **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository:

    - Go to Settings → Pages
    - Under “Build and deployment”, set Source to “GitHub Actions”

2.  **Push to main branch**:

    ``` bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial book setup"
    git push origin main
    ```

3.  **Wait for the workflow** to complete (check the Actions tab)

4.  **Access your book** at:
    `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This template includes several automated workflows to enhance your
development experience:

### 🚀 Publish Workflow (`publish.yml`)

Automatically builds and deploys your book to GitHub Pages when you push
to the main branch.

**Triggers:** Push to main branch, manual dispatch

### 🔍 PR Preview Workflow (`preview.yml`)

Creates a preview deployment for pull requests with:

- Change detection and highlighting
- DOCX files with tracked changes
- Visual indicators for modified chapters
- Banner showing what changed in the PR

**Triggers:** PR opened, reopened, synchronized, closed, labeled, or
unlabeled

**Labels:**

- Add `no-preview-highlights` label to disable change highlighting if
  it’s glitchy

### ✅ Spell Check Workflow (`check-spelling.yaml`)

Runs automated spell checking on pushes and pull requests to maintain
content quality.

**Triggers:** Push to main, pull requests

### 📋 Lint Project Workflow (`lint-project.yaml`)

Checks R code style and quality using the lintr package.

**Triggers:** Push to main/master, pull requests

**Note:** Only runs if your project contains R code.

### 🤖 Copilot Setup Steps (`copilot-setup-steps.yml`)

Configures the GitHub Copilot coding agent’s environment with Quarto and
TinyTeX.

**Triggers:** Workflow dispatch, changes to the setup file

### 📝 Issue Summary Workflow (`summary.yml`)

Automatically generates AI-powered summaries for newly opened issues.

**Triggers:** New issue opened

**Permissions required:** The `models: read` permission for AI inference

### 📚 Check Bibliography DOIs Workflow (`check-bibliography-dois.yml`)

Validates that all books and articles in bibliography files meet DOI
requirements:

- Every book and article must have a DOI field
- Every DOI must resolve to a valid URL
- Reference information is checked against DOI metadata for consistency

**Triggers:** Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch

**Note:** This helps maintain high-quality bibliographic references and
ensures all citations are properly traceable.

## Automated Workflows

This template includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

### Publishing Workflow (`publish.yml`)

Automatically builds and deploys your book to GitHub Pages when you push
to the main branch.

### Link Checker Workflow (`check-links.yml`)

Automatically checks that all URLs in your book are reachable:

- **Runs on**: Push to main, pull requests, weekly schedule (Mondays at
  9:00 UTC), and manual trigger
- **Checks**: All links in `.qmd`, `.md`, and `.html` files
- **Reports**: Workflow fails if broken links are detected. Check the
  workflow logs for details on which links are broken.
- **Configuration**: Customize behavior in `lychee.toml`
- **Manual override**: Add the `links checked by hand` label to a PR to
  skip the automated link check

To manually trigger the link checker:

1.  Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2.  Select “Check Links” workflow
3.  Click “Run workflow”

## Writing Content

Quarto uses markdown with extensions. Here are some quick tips:

### Headings

``` markdown
# Chapter Title
## Section
### Subsection
```

### Code blocks

```` markdown
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Math equations

``` markdown
Inline: $E = mc^2$

Display:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

### Citations

Reference a citation: `@citationkey`

### Cross-references

Reference figures, tables, and sections using labels:

``` markdown
See @fig-example for details.
```

For more details, see the [Quarto
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

## Customization

### Changing themes

Edit the `format.html.theme` section in `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: cosmo  # Try: cosmo, flatly, litera, minty, etc.
      dark: darkly  # Try: darkly, cyborg, slate, superhero, etc.
```

### Adding chapters

1.  Create a new `.qmd` file (e.g., `chapter3.qmd`)
2.  Add it to the `chapters` list in `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - chapter1.qmd
    - chapter2.qmd
    - chapter3.qmd  # Your new chapter
    - references.qmd
```

### Custom CSS

Add your custom styles to `styles.css`. These will override the default
theme styles.
